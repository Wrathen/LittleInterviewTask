Interview Task for Team LSW

<h2>Changelog:</h2>
**All Times are in GMT +3**

- [03:41am 23/09/2022] Project set-up done using Unity 2021.3.2f1.
- [03:44am 23/09/2022] As the task is open-ended, the design-part is left to the interviewee. I am in the stage of thinking what the main game-loop will be. I'm leaning towards RPG-ish elements, like melee combat maybe some ranged combat as well, character creation and also Inventory/Shop/NPC/Interaction systems are required.
- [03:53am 24/09/2022] Haven't fully decided on what the main game loop will be. Will adapt along the way, but the things I want are pretty much set in my mind. Inventory, NPC, Shop, Equipment, Items, Interactions, Player, Enemies, Combat, Collectibles, Character Creation.
- [03:56am 24/09/2022] Imported a lot of free assets from Unity Store. I know I won't be using many of them, but, I want to be able to pick from various amount of assets when I'm choosing some image/visuals for anything I'm doing.
- [5:04am 24/09/2022] Some basic level design with environment is done.
