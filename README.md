Interview Task for Team LSW

<h2>Changelog:</h2>

**All Times are in GMT +3**

- **[03:41am 23/09/2022]** Project set-up done using Unity 2021.3.2f1.
- **[03:44am 23/09/2022]** As the task is open-ended, the design-part is left to the interviewee. I am in the stage of thinking what the main game-loop will be. I'm leaning towards RPG-ish elements, like melee combat maybe some ranged combat as well, character creation and also Inventory/Shop/NPC/Interaction systems are required.
- **[03:53am 24/09/2022]** Haven't fully decided on what the main game loop will be. Will adapt along the way, but the things I want are pretty much set in my mind. Inventory, NPC, Shop, Equipment, Items, Interactions, Player, Enemies, Combat, Collectibles, Character Creation.
- **[03:56am 24/09/2022]** Imported a lot of free assets from Unity Store. I know I won't be using many of them, but, I want to be able to pick from various amount of assets when I'm choosing some image/visuals for anything I'm doing.
- **[05:04am 24/09/2022]** Some basic level design with environment is done.

- **[03:14am 08/11/2022]** After 1.5 months I'm returning back to the task. No code was done in this repo, so I decided to continue on this one. All it has is some set-up, environment design (world design), packages, assets etc...
- **[05:51am 08/11/2022]** I had recently re-installed Win10, thus a lot of setups were required. Took some time to get WinSDK's, VSCode Intellisense working. Implemented some basic Player, PlayerMovement, PlayerAnimation Scripts. Next step seems like getting some NPC's, Enemies done. There are collision checks right now but there are flaws. Will polish it later. Planning to do Interactables/chests on the world. I could implement chopping trees as a feature but I need assets :( I wish I had unlimited access to every asset I needed instantly, would make everything so much easier.
