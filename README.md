Interview Task for Team LSW

<h2>Changelog:</h2>
**All Times are in GMT +3**
[03:41am 23/09/2022] Project set-up done using Unity 2021.3.2f1.
[03:44am 23/09/2022] As the task is open-ended, the design-part is left to the interviewee. I am in the stage of thinking what the main game-loop will be. I'm leaning towards RPG-ish elements, like melee combat maybe some ranged combat as well, character creation and also Inventory/Shop/NPC/Interaction systems are required.
